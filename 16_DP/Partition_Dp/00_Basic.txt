1. How to know if the partition DP will be used in this question? 

-> Whenever there are mutliple ways to solve the question, mutliple parts, 
for example, 
1 + 3 + 4 x 3, You can solve this in mutliple ways. One way to solve this is (1 + 3) + (4 x 3) another way
would be (1 + 2 + 3) X 4. Both will yeild different answers so you can solve this question in multiple partitions.
Here partition DP will be applied.

2. You will be given a data structure and you will have to solve the questions by doing some partitions in the DS

-> for example, [i     k    j]
this is an array with starting point i and ending point j with a partition k in between at some index
