// MULTIPLICATION OF TWO MATRICES 


// Number of operations in multiplying two matrices 

// suppose their are Two
// matrix A of size -> M X N
// matrix B of size -> N X P
// Total number of operations in forming one element of resultant matrix ->
    // For forming one element of resultant matrix you need to multiply 
    // the ith row of matrix A with ith column of matrix B and add them 
    // which n multiplications and n - 1 additions that is a total of 2n - 1 operations
// Size of the resultant matrix will be M X P 
// Total number of operations will be = total operations for getting one element
