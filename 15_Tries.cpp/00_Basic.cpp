// Trie or a prefix tree is a multi way tree that is used for storing different strings over an alphabet.

// Pattern Matching can be done very efficiently using tries 

// Tries can be build in O(N*avg(L)) time 
// N -> no. of strings to be inserted 
// avg(L) -> average length of strings 


// Functions in a trie -> All these functions can be performed in O(L) time where L is length of the word
// 1. Insert a word 
// 2. Search a word
// 3. Delete a wrord
