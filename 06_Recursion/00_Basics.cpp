// What is Recursion?

// Bookish Language -> When a function calls itself directly or indirectly.
// Desi Bhasha -> Recursion is used where the solution of the main or bigger problem depends upon the a similar type of smaller problem



// Types of Recursion 

// a. Direct Recursion -> a function calls itself from within itself

    // 1. Head Recursion ->  When recursive call is made before the small calculation, that is RC is the first statement

    // 2. Tail Recursion ->  When recursive call is made after the small calculation, that is RC is last satement

    // 3. Tree Recursion -> When RC is made more than once in a function, and if only once it is called linear recursion 

    // 4. Nested Recursion -> When the parameter of a RC is itself a reursive call

// b. InDirect Recursion -> more than one function call one another mutually.
