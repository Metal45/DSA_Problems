// TIme and Space Complexity of Recursive Solutions

// Time Complexity -> Time taken by an algorithm as a function of input (how many comparisions or operations are done with respect to input)
// Space Complexity -> Maximum space required by a algorithm (is vector considered as an auxillary space if only used for returning the answer)

// Make recursive tree of the fucntion 

// -> TIME COMPLEXTIY can be calculated by the number of calls made in the recursive tree 
// -> maximum depth of the tree is the SPACE COMPLEXITY of the solution
