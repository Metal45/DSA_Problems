1. What is a Binary Search Tree?

A Binary Search Tree is a non linear data structure where the values in left subtree is less than the parent node and the values in the right subtree is greater than the
parent node, the left subtree and the right subtree is also a BST.

2. Insertion in BST:


3. Deletion in BST:

There can be 4 possibilites while deleting a node from BST
a. The node is a leaf node -> delete the node 
b. Deleting the node with a single child -> delete the node and connect the child to the parent of the node deleted


4. Searching a node in BST:

TimeComplexity of searching an element in an average case O(H) that is log(N)
similarly for inserting an element in BST 

It can be O(N) also in worst case (skewed BST)


Properties:
Inorder traversal of a BST is sorted
